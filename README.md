# wcnexus

wcnexus is wc's personal website as nexus.

wcnexus v3 is powered by nodejs, with [Angular5][ng] at the front, and [koa][koa] at the back. The mighty angular-cli has been substituted by a dedicated webpack since version 3.

## Prerequisites
- MongoDB > 3.4.0

- Method 1 (Not available yet):
  - Docker 

- Method 2:
  - node.js > 6.9.0
  - (optional) nginx
  - (optional) pm2

## Production Deployment
- Download release dist to your server, and head over to that folder you extracted files to.
- Fill in your configuration for your site and mongoDB.
- `npm install` or `yarn install` to collect node modules.
- Firing up.

  - If you just would like to try it out, you just simply go with `node server/wcnexus`. You may navigate to http://localhost:3000 after this. If deploying on a production server is your case, then you have to perform the following steps:

  - Properly configure your nginx. (e.g. is WIP)

  - [pm2][pm2] is recommended to hold up your node.js app. Running `pm2 start server/wcnexus` will do the trick.
  
- Note: You may also use [Docker][docker] to hold this site after installing Docker on your server. Once the docker image has been uploaded to docker cloud by me (not yet, sryðŸ˜‚), you can also make quick installation by executing `docker run valorad/wcnexus.com`.

- visit http://example.com and you are good to go.
